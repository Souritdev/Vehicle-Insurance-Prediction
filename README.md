# Vehicle-Insurance-Prediction

ðŸš— Vehicle Insurance Prediction 

This project demonstrates a complete Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) pipeline for predicting vehicle insurance outcomes using real-world data. Designed to reflect industry-grade practices, it showcases the end-to-end lifecycle of a machine learning model â€” from data collection to deployment, with a strong emphasis on automation, reproducibility, and scalability.

Key components of the pipeline include:

Data Collection & Preprocessing: Clean and prepare insurance datasets using robust Python scripts.

Model Training & Evaluation: Train predictive models to assess insurance claim likelihood with performance metrics tracking.

Model Deployment: Serve the model using a RESTful API (e.g., FastAPI or Flask) in a Dockerized environment.

CI/CD Automation: Use tools like GitHub Actions to automate testing, training, and deployment processes.

Monitoring & Logging: Lay the groundwork for model monitoring and performance logging in production scenarios.
